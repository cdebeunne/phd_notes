# Non-submodular Visual Attention for Robot Navigation

This paper presents a method to select a relevant subset of landmark for visual inertial navigation (VIN). This is formulated as a maximisation problem on a MSE based function on a set of landmarks that are likely to be seen on a given time horizon. Inspired by the method proposed in [1], the authors use an IMU model and a vision model to derive the information matrix of the future states. This information matrix will be used to evaluate the objective function that is suposedly non-submodular. Three different approaches are proposed: a simple greedy algorithm whose performance bounds are theoretically demonstrated, a randomized greedy algorithm whose approximation bound are demonstrated and a linearization based greedy algorithm whose derivation are explicited and that seems to be an efficient alternative. An experimental comparison of these methods and the one proposed in [1] is performed on a trajectory of the EUROC dataset. blabla calculated. An additionnal experiment was conducted on a small scale scenarios using objects as landmarks. The VIN exhibits a clear performance improvement using the simple greedy algorithm is observed using only 2 landmarks in the estimator.

The related works are summarized in the introduction. This makes sense as this subject was not widely studied in the community and then, a state-of-the-art summary is a great introduction for this paper. Feature selection for visual navigation is fully covered and some related sparsification problems in other fields are cited.
