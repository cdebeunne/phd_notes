# PIPO-SLAM: Lightweight Visual-Inertial SLAM With Preintegration Merging Theory and Pose-Only Descriptions of Multiple View Geometry

Author: Ge

Year: 2024

Notes:
---

* Classic VISLAM with pose graph optimisation 
* Contributions: derivation to merge pre integration factors on redundant KF and pose only implementation of SLAM
* based on ORBSLAM3 
* Results in fewer KF and a smaller covisibility graph
