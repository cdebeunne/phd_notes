## Apropos of the Entrance Pupil and of No-Parallax Point (NPP)

* Entrance pupil = virtual image of the center of the aperture stop
* The virtual entrance pupil is moving around a complex shape wrt to the angle to the optical axis (it is only on the optical axis when the angle is 0)
* No Parallax point (NPP) = point around which the camera can be pivoted that allows the total absence of parallax between two overlapping photo => used to make panoramic photos (for a given incidence angle)
* With fisheye lens, because of the pupils movement, there is not a no parallax point. Only a Least Parallax Point (LPP)
* The camera should be rotated around a point to avoid parallax
* Vignetting = difference of illumination between the center and the periphery of a photo

## Models for the various classical lens projections

* presents the 5 classical projection models: stereographic, equisolid, equidistant, orthographic
* Opinion: this is not "Distortion", this is a feature
