# Point clouds by SLAM-based mobile mapping systems: accuracy and geometric content validation in multisensor survey and stand-alone acquisition

Author: Sammartano

Year: 2018

Notes:
---
* Industrial 3D laser mapping tool tested for cultural heritage (CH): ZEB by geoslam

ZEB:
* rotating 2D laser ranging head + IMU and magnetometers
* ZEB REVO with gopro for coloured pc
* 2D cloud lighter than LIDAR => faster to process
* presenting 5 different scenarios on historical sites
* some surfaces or clouds derived from more precise measurement
systems were considered as ground truth to evaluate the devi-
ation of the studied clouds by means of root mean square error
