Notes:
---
* Meshing 3D = incremental algorithm from sparse keypoints
* extending soa incremental manifold mesh algorithm
* TSDF for large scale reconstruction *3D Modeling on the Go: Interactive 3D Reconstruction of Large-Scale Scenes on Mobile Devices*
* *Incremental solid modeling from sparse
and omnidirectional structure-from-motion data* only use points from SLAM when their 3D position is fixed
