# Camera Calibration with Distortion Models and Accuracy Evaluation

Author: Weng

Year: 1992

Notes:
---

* Three major sources of distortion: radial, decentering and thin prism
* Two steps: distrotion free in closed form then non linear optim for refinement and distortion parameters 
* decentering distortion = tangential distortion
