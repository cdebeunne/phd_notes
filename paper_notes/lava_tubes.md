# Lava Tubes

## I - Lava tubes: the hidden sites for future human habitats on the Moon and Mars

* link: https://www.europlanet-society.org/lava-tubes-the-hidden-sites-for-future-human-habitats-on-the-moon-and-mars/
* University of bologna carried comparison between lava tubes in Mars, Moon and Earth
* Lava tubes are shields from radiation and micro meteorites flux
* The lower the gravity, the larger the lava tube
* Corona Lava tube: 8km long in lanzarote

## II - Internal Simulation for Autonomous Robot Exploration of Lava Tubes

* link: https://www.scitepress.org/papers/2018/68607/68607.pdf
* SLAM performance study in a lava tube with experimental results
* the lava tube *Cueva del Viento* in Icod de los Vinos (Spain)
* Internal simulator to predict the consequences of path planning 
* LiDAR based SLAM with ICP between poses and IMU measurement for orientation, graph optimisation is performed by g2o + generation of a mesh map on demand
* groundtruth provided by markers in the scene, catched with wide angle cameras

## III - Multi-robot Mapping of Lava Tubes

* fine sand in cave makes wheel odometry pourrave
* 3D scanning with 2D Lidar + servo
* 2D SLAM fused with 3D scans via ICP
* two robots: lead-follower. The leader takes 3D scans and the follower measures the relative position and orientation changes with a target on the leader robot
* 3 actions: 
    * the leader moves, its state changes is estimated by the follower
    * the follower moves and estimates its state
    * the leader takes a 3D scan

## IV - Cueva de los verdes

* Lava tube in lanzarotte, spain, perfect for experiments

    * University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria
