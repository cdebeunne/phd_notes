# Lava tubes on Earth, Moon and Mars: A review on their size and morphology revealed by comparative planetology

Author: Sauro

Year: 2020

Notes:

* Survey on Lava tubes 
* Impossible to gather info on the interior -> compare skylight and with teresterial analog
* laser scans of corona cave lanzarote: Subsurface laser scanning and photogrammetry in the Corona Lava Tube System, Lanzarote, Spain 
* compare length/ volume and morphologic profile of lava tubes 

Discussion:
* morphological similarities between earth and moon/mars but limited direct evidences
* roadmap for subsurface exploration is needed
