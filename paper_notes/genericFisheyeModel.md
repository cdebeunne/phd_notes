# A Generic Fisheye camera model for robotic applications

Author: Courbon & co

Year: 2007

Notes:
---
* For a perspective camera r_p = f*tan(theta)
* pinhole based models map r_p to r_f
* captured rays-based models theta -> r_f: equidistance, stereographic...
* Unified model based on projection on a unitary sphere
* This model can both map r_f to r_p and theta to r_f

Interessant de refaire les calculs...
