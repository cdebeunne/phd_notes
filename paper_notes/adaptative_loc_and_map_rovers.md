# Adaptive Localization and Mapping with Application to Planetary Rovers

Notes:
---
* Full graph optimization based on improved wheel odometry model and visual features
* error model of odometry based on Gaussian Process 
* Adapt the frame rate to provide only highly informative KF

## Intro:
* 60% of overlapping is needed to perform VO (why?)
* Post 2020 missions plan to cross 20km in 6 months (vs 15 km in 7 years for MER) (super interesting figure describing all the past and futur missions)
* Need for mapping for futur missions of sample fetching or human base construction
