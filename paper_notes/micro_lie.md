# A micro Lie theory for state estimation in robotics

Author: Joan Solà

Year: 2020

Notes:
---

* SO(3), SE(3)... are Lie groups and smooth manifolds
* exp, log form Lie algebra to Lie group
* Exp : R^n -> M, Log(M) -> R^n ie map directly to the vector space
* hat and vee map from Lie algebra to cartesian space
* Right jacobian is obtained with J_r = f(X⊕tau)-f(X)/tau
* Left jacobian is obtained with J_l = f(tau⊕X)-f(X)/tau
