# LiODOM: Adaptive Local Mapping for Robust LiDAR-Only Odometry

Authors: Emilio Garcia-Fidalgo, Joan P. Company-Corcoles, Francisco Bonnin-Pascual and Alberto Ortiz

Into review process

Notes:
---
* LiDAR only odometry based on point-to-line registering on a local map 
* Efficient data structure for map representation
* Highly inspired by LOAM
