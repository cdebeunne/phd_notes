Apriltag Based Robust Fusion Localization For Mobile Robot
Navigation In Large Indoor Environments

Abstract:
---

-> Localization with Apriltags for indoor factory  environnement, handles partial observation using AEKF (for adaptive measurement noise)
-> Fuse with motion information 
-> Solve kidnapping and image latency using back propagation 

I - Intro:
---
-> LiDAR too expensive
-> VSLAM cheap but lacks accuracy and robustness
-> Using tags enhances robustness, but requires a great number of tags in sight
-> tags observation covariance is an uncertain parameter
-> bad observation of tags may lead to a big uncertainty on the angle: are usually discarded
-> adaptative measurement noise model to take bad observations into account
-> dynamic initiallization for the kidnapping pb
-> contributions: working localization algo in a factory env, AEKF with uncertainty evaluation to include hard-to-use observations, dynamic initialization and back propagation

II - April Tag Mapping:
---
-> build in advance a map with Apriltag using fusion of a LiDAR SLAM (LOAM) and visual observations, the whole apriltag map is optimized unsing gtsam
-> Uses the AprilTag3 detector
-> what is T? Precise it in the beginning 
-> M_k is the set of ID at time k, unclear sentence
-> the notations are strange...
-> back propagation is still not explained...

III - Fusion strategy for localization:
---
A - Strategy 
-> Motion prediction based on both IMU and forklift dynamic models
-> Update step based on partial and complete april tag observations 
-> the update process includes the update process ?? WTF
-> according to figure: back propagation seems to be using prediction to have a prior info on at positions

B - Dynamic Initialization
-> Compute the initial global pose of the robot, or kidnapping ie. after an unexpected inconsistent pose
-> On Fig 3 front and rear wheels are represented, \Beta is the steer wheel angle
-> state made of [x, y, \theta]

C - Update with AT measurements
-> Use the ID of the AT for global map matching 
-> WTF: uses the observation to retrieve the global pose of the robot? I would use a pose error on the AT
-> too big observation errors wrt to the prediction are simply discarded
-> what is x_msr, y_msr, z_msr? Unclear
-> L is already used in the prediction step
-> How did you get this model? 
-> repeat yourself in the 4th paragraph
-> in some cases with high observation angles, the angle is not observable, only the relative distance 
-> The partial observation linearization equations are pretty clear 

D - Back Propagation: used to compensate the delay due to image processing 
-> Case we receive at time $k$ a measurement of time $k-m$
-> Apply update step to $X_{k-m}$ and $P_{k-m}$
-> Then propagate the uncertainty through successive prediction step until time $k$

IV - Experimental Validation
---

A - Conditions
-> Compare with TagSLAM, EKF (ie without adaptative methods), AEKF without partial updates, full proposed method
-> It lacks informations about the dataset, length? duration? 

B - Performance
-> What groundtruth do you use? The LiDAR SLAM, a mocap? 

C - Kidnapping
-> the figure is not clear, maybe a bigger zoom would be better

D - Delay
-> A bit pretentious to say "we solved", you proposed a solution for your practical usecase 
 
Minor reviews:
-> I, par 5: consistency*
-> I, first bullet point: that has* instead of "and has"
-> I, second bullet point: filter* 
-> II, par2: then, *
-> II, par3: what does "modulenany" means? this is unclear
-> II, par4: denotes*
-> III, A, par1: proposes* 
-> III, A, par1: deployable*
-> III, A, par1: "The update processes include the update process" there is a typo and it is repetitive 
-> III, B, par1: which is calculated*
-> III, B, par2: the previous state*
-> III, B: the 2) (Evolution, prediction?) is missing 
-> Figure3: is a front-wheel steering vehicle*
-> III, C, par1: receives its pose*
-> III, C, par2: "concerning about" strange formulation
-> III, C, par2: in different ways*
-> III, C, par2: if the noise model fits experimental errors statistics, a figure would be great to illustrate the model. 
-> Lots of clumsy formulations
-> III, C, after equation block: no need to rewrite \tilde{Z_{k+1}} and H_{k+1}
-> IV, A, par2: "and performed accurate calibration..." incorrect sentence, needs to be rephrased
-> IV, A, par2 : "and try to ensure..." This needs to be rephrased 
-> IV, B, par1: "Various..." methodS, and higher? 
-> IV, C: substract*
-> IV, C: inconsistency*
-> IV, C: can maintain*
-> IV, D: we present*
-> IV, D: are shown in Fig 7 and table II*
-> IV, D: have proven*
-> V: takes advantage of*
-> V: adaptively adjust*
-> V: but also update*
-> V: with extra partial observations*

Tips and remarks:
-> Try to write shorter sentences. Long sentences may be unclear, especially when dealing with a technical topic.
-> The "Dynamic initialization" is more a software detail than a proper scientific contribution

Sum up:
This paper deals with a Localization based on the fusion of visual observations and motion prediction through an EKF for indoor navigation. It uses AprilTags on a pre loaded map that was generated using a LiDAR SLAM algorithm. 
The paper details the motion model of a forklift for the prediction step and a dynamic initialization method. The observation step can be performed for both fully observable and partially observable tags. An adaptative noise model is also introduced to give a strong weight to bad observations. Finally, a backpropagation methods is described to perform update with observations from older frames.
The method is validated with two trajectories recorded in a factory with a forklift setup. It is compared to other Tag based methods and specific experiments were conducted to test the dynamic initialization and the delay compensation. 

Critics:
This paper deserves a serious proof read, many typos and bad formulations could be easily spotted and corrected before submission. 
Some of the contributions are a bit weak: the "dynamic initialization" looks more like a software trick and the dataset lacks diversity. The author claims that the algorithm was deployed to perform various task, this additionnal data and situations should be analysed.
The paper is well structured, and the ablation studies are really interesting to highlight the novelties.
